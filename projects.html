              <h3>Benchmarking robustness of VQA models</h3>
              <p>Working on using scene graph perturbations to benchmark biasness in VQA models.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Decreasing Adversarial training time</h3>
              <p>In this project, we showed that we don't need entire training dataset for adversarial training. We can achieve same adevrsarial robustness using a subset of training dataset for adversarial attack.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Black Box Optimisation Competition - NeurIPS 2020</h3>
              <p>In this project we studied Bayesian Optimisation and its application in deep learning. We studied trust regions based optimisation and designed an algorithm for hyperparameter optimisation which can work with any deep learning algorithm.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Document Visual Question Answering Challenge(DocVQA) - CVPR 2020</h3>
              <p>In this project we used a variation of BERT which jointly models text and layout information to effectively answer questions based on scanned Document Images. Our method ranks 4th on the leaderboard on the novel dataset provided by competition authors against very competitive academic and commercial research labs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Face Deduplication</h3>
              <p>In this project, I worked on detecting if a new face entry is already part of a database of 40 million faces. To do it in real time for commercial use, our models ran in less than 0.3 seconds - HyperVerge</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Text Extraction OCR</h3>
              <p>Worked on buiding new OCR models for national identity cards for 2 countries. The aim was to automate the information extraction task for national identity cards - HyperVerge</p>
